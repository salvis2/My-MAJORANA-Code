# My-MAJORANA-Code
Code that primarily I have developed for the MAJORANA Collaboration. 

full_eff_plotter.py is the capstone script, running DCRcomparison.py and eff_chan_plotter.py. 
It is submitted to a supercomputer via runFullComp.csh and submitFullCompJob.csh.

angery.py and specificEffplots.py are scripts that were run once to achieve a set of job submission commands and to get specific graphs in a smaller file.

All of the .csh scripts are for submitting jobs to the supercomputer PDSF. Some of them reference programs that I did not make, and thus aren't shown here.
